sCENARIO 1


FIRTST SCENARIO WE HATE TO  generate a pair of public keys using following command.IN SERVER SIDE 

NOTE:- WE HAVE TO GENERATE CLIENT SIDE ALSO DIFENDING ON REQUIREMENT we can use.


ssh-keygen -t rsa


u can see to files.
 
id_rsa  id_rsa.pub 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Create .ssh Directory on CLIENT SERVER UNDER USERHOME DIRECTORY.

#mkdir /home/krishna/.ssh | touch authorized_keys.

or 

ssh sheena@192.168.0.11 mkdir -p .ssh.


upload new generated public key (id_rsa.pub) on  client server  under sheena‘s(user's)  .ssh directory as a file name --->  authorized_keys.

mannually or  " cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh sheena@clientserverip  'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys' "

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Set permission like 


chmod 700 .ssh; chmod 640 .ssh/authorized_keys"    on client side.





++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

ssh sheena@192.168.0.11   


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


SECOND SENARIO.

1).


ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -v           GENERATE A KEY CLIENT SIDE OR SERVER SIDE.


You will be asked for a file name,    GIVE A FILE NAME LIKE test.

it will generate a test file and the test  file without file extension, rename it to test.pem,

u have two keyw in ur pwd.


test.pem  test.pub.


2) Uploading the generated certificate from client computer to server.


mannuvally or  using this command "ssh-copy-id -i ~/test.pub root@12.34.56.78"(server ip).

or 

scp -vr test.pub   root@serverip:/root/.ssh/authorized_keys.


check once key is copied or not in server side " now try to login with pem key.


$ sudo ssh -i ~/hetzner.pem root@12.34.56.78.
